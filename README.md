### Hi there 👋 I'm Benjamin.

I'm a software developer specialising in frontend development.

When I have the time and opportunity I love contributing to open source projects. Some of my contributions include:

- ⭐ I am a core contributor to [Best of JS](https://github.com/bestofjs/bestofjs-webui) and [JavaScript Rising Stars](https://github.com/bestofjs/javascript-risingstars)
- 💾 I am the current maintainer of the [ngrx-store-localstorage](https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-store-localstorage) NPM module
- 📚 I wrote a guide on how to create a [Angular Router and AngularJs UI Router hybrid app](https://github.com/BBlackwo/angular-router-angular-js-ui-router-hybrid/blob/master/guide/) as no other complete guides had been written about this (AFAIK)
- 🟩 Lots of other small contributions to various projects that I have used you can see in the below **Contribution activity** section
